This project involves creating and managing a comprehensive database for a fictional online retail company using SQL Server. The database includes tables for customers, products, orders, order items, and categories. The project covers a wide range of SQL techniques, from basic to advanced queries, data aggregation, indexing, view creation, security features, and backup management. The objective is to enhance database performance, ensure data integrity, and implement robust security measures, providing a complete end-to-end solution for managing an online retail store’s data.
